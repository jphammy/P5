Assignment 5: Resource Management
Due: 04/24/19

The purpose of this project was to design and implement a resource management
tool for OSS, my operating system simulator. This project is intended to use
deadlock avoidance to manage resources, with processes being blocked on their 
requests until requests are safe. I chose to use the Banker's Algorithm for
deadlock avoidance which is implement in oss.c and adapted from 
www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-bankers-algorithm-set-1-safety-algorithm/

To implement:
1) make
2a) ./oss
2b) ./oss -v //verbose mode

Notes:
Logfile resource.log will display processes requests, granted, terminated, detection
of processes and allocated resource table (not fully working). If given the 
opportunity, I will work on this portion for project 7 to fix some bugs.

Achievements:
Main oss exectuables forks child processes at random times, creates new processes when
forked, table to keep track of system state, activities including process requests,
granted, termination, detection is output to resource.log and statistics are displayed 
to stderr as well. Shared memory and message queue are set up appropriately and defined
in resourceManagement.h file
